1. npm install netlify-cli
2.create netlify.toml file in which you config where the netlify server will find serverless functions
3. create a folder called functions for ex, and in that folder create js files in which write serverless functions
4. each serverless function must have name handler --> exports.handler = async(event,context) {
															return{
																statusCode:'200',
																body:'wfwefwff'
															}
														}
														
!! the return statement is basicaly the http response from netlify server after executing serverless functions 


BY DEFAULT the url of the api is domain/.netlify/functions/1-hello(domain is your domain(for ex http://localhost:8888))
and 1-hello is the name of serverless function BUT you can redirect the url to something more ease to use like /api/serverless-function-name -> see netlify.toml 

// to allow the access to serverless functions from other applications
// that are not deployed on netlify set headers in sercerless functions as bellow
// then you can access serverless function by fetching data from -> //domain/.netlify/functions/<function name>
